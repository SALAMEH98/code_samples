I WENT TO KREL LABORATORIES TO INVESTIGATE AND WAS TOLD THAT I NEEDED TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER, WHO WAS NOT THERE, SO I ARRANGED TO MEET HIM THE FOLLOWING DAY. ON APRIL 5TH, 2017, I INSPECTED THE SITE ALONG WITH MY SUPERVISOR, TERRY SHEAHAN. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY CHEMICAL ODORS IN THE AREA UP ARRIVAL. WE MET WITH THE PRESIDENT AND CO-OWNER OF THE COMPANY, MR. ROBERT OLEKSYN. PER MR. OLEKSYN, KREL LABS RUN ONE SHIFT FROM 7:30AM ? 4:00PM WITH A TOTAL OF 12 EMPLOYEES. KREL LABS IS A METAL PLATING COMPANY AND HAS THREE BUILDINGS, ALL IN PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER (382, 383 AND 388 N. AVERS). WE OBSERVED A CURRENT CITY BUSINESS AND HAZMAT LICENSES IN THE MAIN OFFICE (BLD. 388) AS WELL AS A CURRENT CERTIFICATE OF OPERATION FROM CDPH. WE ALSO WHERE SHOWN A CURRENT DISCHARGE PERMIT FROM MWRD FOR THEIR WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEM ON SITE. WE EXPLAINED THAT WE ORIGINALLY CAME FOR A CHEMICAL ODOR IN THE AREA AND INQUIRED IF THEY HAD ANY RELEASES OR EQUIPMENT FAILURES OVER THE PAST WEEK AND WERE TOLD THAT THEY DID NOT. 

WE THEN EXPLAINED THAT WE NEEDED TO DO A FULL ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTION AND WOULD LIKE TO INSPECT ALL BUILDINGS, PROCESSES AND PAPERWORK FOR ALL SPECIAL WASTE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ON SITE. WHEN ASKED IF WE COULD REVIEW THE LAST THREE YEARS OF MANIFESTS, MR. OLEKSYN STATED THAT ?NO WASTE HAS EVER BEEN SHIPPED OFFSITE FROM THE FACILITY?. WE THEN PROCEEDED TO INSPECT EACH BUILDING WITH MR. OLEKSYN.

WE FIRST INSPECTED THE LAB IN BLD. 388. THERE WERE CHEMICALS THROUGHOUT THE LAB ON SHELVES, THE FLOOR, AND IN CABINET?S. MANY OF THE CHEMICALS WERE NOT PROPERLY LABELED/UNKNOWN AND MANY WERE IN CONTAINERS THAT FELL APART OR WERE FALLING APART. WE INFORMED MR. OLEKSYN THAT HE NEEDS TO RE-PACKAGE MANY OF THE CHEMICALS INTO PROPER CONTAINERS AND MAKE SURE ALL CHEMICALS ARE PROPERLY MANAGED, LABELED, AND SEGREGATED. WE THEN PROCEEDED INTO THE PLATING PART OF BLD. 388. THERE WERE CHEMICALS AROUND EVERY CORNER, MANY UNLABELED/UNKNOWN AND OPEN OR NOT IN PROPER CONTAINERS. THERE WAS VERY POOR HOUSEKEEPING THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING AND THE PLATING LINES APPEARED TO HAVE YEARS/INCHES OF CAKED UP CHEMICALS/DRAG-OUT ON THE FLOORS AND AROUND THE PLATING BATHS. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISCERN BETWEEN WASTE CHEMICALS AND PRODUCT. WE OBSERVED A SPRAY BOOTH THAT WAS IN USE, BUT DID NOT HAVE ANY FILTERS. MR. OLEKSYN WAS INFORMED TO STOP SPRAYING UNTIL PROPER FILTERS ARE ACQUIRED AND INSTALLED. WE OBSERVED MANY DRUMS OF CORROSIVES, POISONS, OXIDIZERS AND FLAMMABLES THROUGHOUT THE BUILDING IN VARIOUS AMOUNTS AND CONTAINERS. IN ADDITION TO THE HOUSEKEEPING ISSUES, WE OBSERVED VARIOUS BUILDING ISSUES SUCH AS LARGE HOLES IN THE ROOF AND EXPOSED ELECTRICAL WIRING. I ALSO SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME POTENTIALLY FRIABLE ASBESTOS ON SOME PIPES AND ON THE JACKET OF THE BOILER.

IN BLD. 383 IT WAS MORE OF THE SAME WITH DRUMS OF POTASSIUM CYANIDE,",DEPT. OF PUBLIC HEALTH,04/11/2017,41.887814428749,-87.72270571568168,POINT (-87.72270571568168 41.887814428749),30,27,21572,658,45

I MET MIGUEL ESPINO (SUPERVISOR WITH LAGOS GENERAL CONTRACTORS) ?HE ADMITTED THAT ONE OF HIS WORKERS HAD CUT A BRICK WITHOUT USING WATER. THEY DID HAVE THE NECESSARY WET-SAW BUT THE WORKER HAD NEGLECTED TO USE IT. A NEIGHBOR HAD LEFT A NOTE ABOUT THIS ON ESPINO?S TRUCK. ESPINO ASSURED ME THAT HE HAD ADDRESSED THIS WITH HIS WORKERS AND THAT THIS WOULD NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. I ALSO NOTED THAT THEIR SITE FENCE WAS TIED TO THE NEIGHBOR?S FENCE TO THE NORTH.

THE NEIGHBOR HAD GIVEN HIM PERMISSION TO TIE OFF IN THIS FASHION.
