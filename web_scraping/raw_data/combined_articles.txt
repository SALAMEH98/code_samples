Afghanistan earthquake leaves 800 dead, thousands homeless. A 5.9 magnitude earthquake struck the Central Region of eastern Afghanistan in the early hours of Wednesday morning, causing devastation in remote mountainous areas of Paktika and Khost provinces which were already suffering the effects of heavy rain. The rain and strong winds hampered initial search and rescue efforts. Nearly 800 people had been confirmed dead by Friday morning and more than 1,400 injured, while thousands of homes have been destroyed or damaged. Survivors spoke to The Guardian about losing their entire extended family and villages being buried. UNHCR, together with other UN agencies and partner organizations, has been rushing staff and humanitarian supplies to the affected areas to provide shelter for those left homeless. The agency said more support was urgently needed to avert a humanitarian disaster in the affected areas. The earthquake – the worst to hit the country in 20 years – comes as Afghanistan is grappling with a severe economic and humanitarian crisis with some 3.5 million people displaced by conflict inside the country and millions more struggling to survive amid rising levels of hunger and poverty.
Fighting in Ukraine takes increasingly heavy toll on civilians. The International Committee of the Red Cross warned this week that the humanitarian situation for millions of civilians in Ukrainian cities bearing the brunt of ongoing fighting is deteriorating four months into the war. In Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Donetsk and Kharkiv, homes, schools, hospitals, bridges, and other infrastructure have been damaged or destroyed and vital services cut off. Many of those who remain are elderly and in need of medical treatment that is no longer available. The BBC reports from the outskirts of Lysychansk, where volunteers in body armour are dodging shelling to help evacuate families given only 15 minutes to pack up their lives and leave their homes. The city has already been cut off from water, electricity, and mobile phone networks, but local officials estimate that between 7,000 and 8,000 civilians remain there.
Ethiopians flee massacre that killed hundreds. Reports of an attack by gunmen in Ethiopia’s western Oromia region on Saturday suggest that between 260 and 320 civilians were killed. Residents told AP the victims were ethnic Amharas, a minority in the region, and that other members of the community were desperately seeking to be relocated. The attack occurred in Gimbo district in the western part of Oromia. Ethiopia is experiencing one of the world’s most acute displacement crises. A conflict that erupted in late 2020 in the north of the country has since spread to other regions, creating huge internal displacement and sending refugees into Sudan. Meanwhile, WFP warned on Thursday that drought in the south of the country has pushed 7.4 million people into hunger.

Côte d’Ivoire welcomes returning families as refugee status set to end. Some 14,000 Ivorian refugees have returned home so far this year, the majority of them from Liberia, ahead of the formal ending of their refugee status on 30 June. UNHCR described the resolution of a crisis that at its height forced more than 300,000 people to flee to neighbouring countries as a “welcome bright spot” amid a rising global trend of forced displacement. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, celebrated World Refugee Day in Côte d’Ivoire after accompanying a group of refugees returning home from Liberia. More than 310,000 Ivorian refugees, or 96 per cent of all those registered across West Africa, have chosen to return home. UNHCR is organizing weekly transportation from Liberia for returnees, including young people who have no memory of their home country.
Refugee resettlement needs rising steeply. UNHCR estimates that more than 2 million refugees will require resettlement next year, up 36 per cent from this year’s 1.47 million. Spokesperson Shabia Mantoo attributed the rise to the impacts of the COVID pandemic, the emergence of new displacement crises and the protracted nature of many existing ones. Resettlement of refugees from a country of asylum to another country that has agreed to admit them and allow them to settle there permanently is only available to a tiny fraction of the world’s most vulnerable refugees, with just under 40,000 refugees departing for resettlement last year. UNHCR is appealing for countries to make more predictable, multi-year resettlement commitments and to speed up processing and departure arrangements.
New survey finds public support for refugees has increased. A survey released by Ipsos on World Refugee Day on Monday reveals that 78 per cent of people in 28 countries believe those fleeing conflict or persecution should be able to take refuge in another country. The result is up from 70 per cent in 2021, suggesting that the outpouring of public support for people fleeing the war in Ukraine may have led to a shift in attitudes towards refugees in the countries surveyed. “We hope this momentum can be maintained, so that all, and not some, refugees have access to protection and receive support,” commented Gillian Triggs, UNHCR’s Assistant High Commissioner for Protection. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed supported allowing more refugees into their country for those fleeing war or violent conflict. Support was lower for those fleeing persecution and views were divided on whether governments should be providing more support to refugees and asylum seekers. traffickers. UNHCR is calling for more action to prevent deaths and abuses of refugees and asylum seekers who embark on these journeys. asylum seekers who embark on these journeys.

Number of people forced to flee doubles within a decade. Some 89.3 million people were forcibly displaced due to war, violence, persecution, and human rights abuses at the end of 2021, according to UNHCR’s annual Global Trends report released on Thursday. The number is up 8 per cent from a year earlier and well over double the figure of 10 years ago. Since then, millions more have fled Ukraine or been displaced within its borders, pushing the figure to over 100 million. According to the report, a record 27.1 million people were living as refugees by the end of 2021, while the number of asylum seekers rose 11 per cent to 4.6 million. The number of people displaced within their own countries rose for the 15th straight year to 53.2 million. Speaking to journalists, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi warned that a global food crisis stoked by the war in Ukraine threatens to further accelerate displacement. “The impact, if this is not resolved quickly, would be devastating,” Grandi said. “It is already devastating,” he added, noting the growing food insecurity, conflict and climate extremes driving new displacement from the Sahel and other regions. Grandi hailed the generous response to the Ukraine crisis but highlighted other crises that remain underfunded.
UK plans more Rwanda deportations after European court grounds first flight. The British government said on Wednesday it would continue organizing flights to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda after a last-minute court judgement grounded the first plane due to take off under the policy on Tuesday night. Senior judges in the UK had ruled that the flight could go ahead, although individual appeals had brought the number of people on the flight down to seven. A ruling by the European Court of Human Rights granting a temporary injunction for one of the seven asylum seekers allowed lawyers for the other six to make successful applications and the flight was cancelled. The UK government has described the agreement with Rwanda as a legitimate way of protecting lives and thwarting the smugglers who send asylum seekers across the English Channel in small boats. However, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi on Monday described the policy as “all wrong” for multiple reasons, adding that “the precedent that this creates is catastrophic”. A challenge to the legality of the policy is expected to be heard next month.
Thousands flee massacre in Burkina Faso. Nearly 16,000 people, mainly women and children, have arrived in Dori, in eastern Burkina Faso, after fleeing a brutal attack by armed men in the town of Seytenga, near the border with Niger. Another 360 people have reportedly crossed into Niger’s Tillabéri region. The attack on Saturday night left at least 79 people dead, with some media reports putting the death toll even higher. New arrivals in Dori gave accounts of armed men going door-to-door to seek out and kill adult males. Al Jazeera reports that Seytenga was the site of fighting last week between armed groups and government forces. UNHCR said more people are expected to arrive in Dori over the coming days, putting further pressure on a town that has already grown fivefold due to successive waves of displacement. Burkina Faso’s displacement crisis is one of the world’s fastest growing, with some 1.9 million people forced to flee their homes since 2015.

UN leaders call for cross-border aid route to Syria to remain open. The heads of seven UN agencies, including UNHCR, issued a joint appeal on Thursday calling on members of the UN Security Council to keep open the last remaining cross-border aid route into Syria. On 10 July, the council is due to vote on whether to renew a resolution that allows the UN and its partners to deliver humanitarian aid to northwest Syria via the Bab al-Hawa crossing from Türkiye. The decision is critical for the 4.1 million people living in the non-government-controlled region that rely on humanitarian aid to survive, many of whom have been displaced from other parts of the country. Last year, aid delivered via the crossing reached 2.4 million people each month. By comparison, aid from government-controlled areas of Syria only reached 40,000 people. Mark Cutts, the UN’s deputy regional humanitarian coordinator in Syria, said if would be a “catastrophe” if the resolution is not renewed.
Hunger and poverty surge in Afghanistan. Aid agencies stepped up calls this week for increased global support to stem spiralling hunger and malnutrition in Afghanistan, where another poor rainy season is expected to leave farmers and their families in dire need. Famine-like conditions have already been detected among 20,000 people in central Ghor province. The Washington Post reports that thousands of families have fled from the countryside, only to face further deprivation in cities such as Herat where many live in makeshift camps. Aid cuts following the Taliban’s takeover last August have hit the economy hard, pushing up food prices and slashing average incomes by a third. In Kabul, the capital, many are reduced to buying stale leftover bread to survive, reports the BBC.
New wave of violence in northern Mozambique forces over 17,500 people to flee. At least seven people have been killed and nearly 17,700 people displaced by recent attacks in northern Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province. The latest attacks took place in Ancuabe district, an area previously considered safe where many families displaced from other districts were being hosted. Residents who fled the area described beheadings, rapes, house burnings and abductions, according to Save the Children, which said the attacks had also impacted humanitarian operations to support previously displaced families. UNHCR said it was working with partner organizations to assist the newly displaced. Over 784,000 people have fled their homes since the conflict in Cabo Delgado started in October 2017. traffickers.

Summit of the Americas to deliver declaration on migration. Migration and forced displacement took centre stage at a summit for regional leaders hosted by US President Joe Biden in Los Angeles this week. Before it opened on Tuesday, the Biden administration announced US$1.9 billion in private sector funding to help create economic opportunities in Central America and address some of the drivers of migration and forced displacement from the region. The gathering, which was also attended by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, is expected to conclude today with a joint declaration from Biden and Latin American leaders, as well as Spain and Canada, committing to a more integrated approach to managing migration. US officials said it would commit nations across the region to receive migrants and provide avenues for them to secure humanitarian protection and earn a living. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told CNN that the approach would be one of “shared responsibility” between countries of origin, transit countries and countries of destination. However, the leaders of Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras – key countries of origin and transit for migrants and asylum-seekers – stayed away from the summit, raising questions about the significance of the joint declaration. The meeting took place as several thousand mainly Venezuelan migrants and asylum-seekers began moving towards the US border from southern Mexico as part of a “caravan” after growing frustrated with the long wait to regularize their status.
UK’s Rwanda deportation plans face legal challenges. The UK Home Office’s plans to send a first group of asylum seekers to Rwanda on 14 June, under a deal between the two countries agreed last month, faced two legal challenges this week. The first, launched on Wednesday by a trade union that represents Border Force staff, two charities and four asylum seekers facing removal to Rwanda, involved an application for a judicial review of the lawfulness of the policy in the high court. The claimants also sought an injunction to prevent Tuesday’s flight from going ahead. The hearing is being held today. The claimants said that if they lose, they will appeal and UNHCR said it would join the appeal.  A second application for a judicial review was made on Thursday by refugee charity Asylum Aid, which also applied for an urgent interim injunction preventing any flights from leaving. It was also reported on Wednesday that Zambia may be the next country to accept asylum seekers who arrive to the UK under a similar agreement to the one with Rwanda.
New data reflects refugee movements from and to Ukraine. According to new data from national authorities that was released by UNHCR this week, at least 4.8 million refugees from Ukraine have been recorded across Europe. The figure includes those who initially crossed into neighbouring countries and then moved onwards to other countries. Some 3.2 million have registered for Temporary Protection or similar national protection schemes. UNHCR said the war in Ukraine had “caused one of the largest human displacement crises in the world today” with many more people displaced inside the country. As of 7 June, more than 7.3 million border crossings out of Ukraine have been recorded, with another 2.3 million crossings back into the country. UNHCR noted that some return to check on property or visit family members while others are going to Western Ukraine and areas around Kyiv and Chernihiv intending to stay. Many return to find their homes damaged or struggle to find jobs and are forced to leave again.

Climate, conflict fuel multiple food crises. Two UN agencies issued warnings on Monday about emerging food crises across the globe driven by climate “shocks” like drought that have been worsened by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The report by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) flags 20 “hunger hotspots” where acute hunger is expected to worsen over the coming months. Six countries are facing the most “catastrophic conditions”: Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen, with as many as 750,000 people already facing starvation and death. The report describes climate shocks including droughts, flooding, hurricanes and cyclones as a “new normal” that is decimating farming and driving displacement and hunger across the world. In a statement on Thursday, Médecins Sans Frontières said at least 35 children had died in recent weeks in Ethiopia’s north-eastern Afar region due to drought and conflict.
Attacks in northwest Nigeria leave at least 32 dead. Gunmen on motorbikes attacked four villages in the Kujuru area of Kaduna state on Sunday, killing at least 32 people and abducting more than 20 others, residents told AP. Such attacks have become frequent in Nigeria’s north-west, as disputes between herdsmen and settled farmers over access to land for grazing, aggravated by the climate crisis, have become increasingly deadly. Poor telecommunications delayed reporting of the attacks which occurred on the same day that more than 30 people were killed in an attack on a Catholic church in southwestern Ondo. Nigerian security officials said on Thursday they suspected extremists from the Islamic State’s affiliate in west Africa were behind the attack in Ondo, a state previously known as one of Nigeria’s safest, although no group has yet claimed responsibility.
Mediterranean crossings increasingly fatal. While the reported number of refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean has fallen since a peak of 1 million in 2015, journeys are becoming more fatal. A new data visualization released by UNHCR shows that between 2014 and 2021, over 24,400 people have died or gone missing trying to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe, including 3,231 last year. Many others die or suffer abuses along land routes that typically involve relying on smugglers to cross the Sahara Desert and risking detention and further human rights abuses in Libya. The data visualization focuses on the routes from the East and Horn of Africa and includes the individual stories of refugees from Eritrea and Somalia describing the horrors they endured at the hands of traffickers. UNHCR is calling for more action to prevent deaths and abuses of refugees and asylum seekers who embark on these journeys. asylum seekers who embark on these journeys.

No end in sight after 100 days of conflict in Ukraine. The war in Ukraine reached the grim milestone of 100 days on Friday, with no end in sight to the conflict that has sparked Europe’s biggest displacement crisis since the Second World War. On Friday, UNHCR’s Representative in Ukraine, Karolina Lindholm Billing, told journalists the situation inside the country remains “very fluid, and the outlook for the innocent victims of this brutal and senseless war is fragile.” Many people are still fleeing fighting or remain displaced, while others have returned home only to have to flee once more, she added. So far, UNHCR and its partners have assisted over 1.2 million people across Ukraine with life-saving aid, counselling and other vital services, and the agency is ramping up its efforts to help people repair their damaged homes. The UN’s crisis coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, called for an immediate end to a war that he said will have no winners. “In just over three months, nearly 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes – a scale and speed of displacement not witnessed in history,” Awad added.
UK plans first Rwanda flight in mid-June. The UK government has confirmed plans to send a first group of asylum seekers to Rwanda on 14 June, after the Home Office sent notices to asylum claimants informing them of their imminent departure. Syrians, Afghans, Egyptians and Chadians were among those who received letters telling them they would be on the flight. On Friday, the Guardian reported that at least 17 people from Syria, Egypt and Sudan being held in a detention centre ahead of the flight had gone on hunger strike, and that one had received a letter warning they could be deported sooner if they did not stop. Meanwhile, charities and campaign groups warned the threat of being sent to Rwanda is having a “severe impact on mental health” among people in the UK asylum system. They pointed to reports of those earmarked for deportation becoming mentally unwell, and even those not directly impacted by the policy growing more anxious and distressed.
Ukraine conflict fuelling hunger in Africa, officials warn. Rising food prices driven by the war in Ukraine are increasing levels of hunger for millions of people in Africa already affected by conflict and climate change, officials warned this week. “Food, fuel and fertiliser costs have skyrocketed and the decline in purchasing power is hitting the most vulnerable households the hardest, including refugees and displaced people,” UNHCR Assistant High Commissioner for Operations, Raouf Mazou, told AFP this week after a special African Union summit to discuss the continent’s humanitarian crises. Mazou said that in the longer term, more needed to be done to mitigate climate change in Africa and increase sustainable farming levels to reduce dependence on imports. Following the summit, Senegalese President and current chair of the African Union, Macky Sall, said the continent’s dependence on Ukrainian and Russian wheat risks a “catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises unless exports resume. Before the war, African countries imported 44 per cent of their wheat from the two countries. The New York Times reports that Sall will travel to Russia to urge a lifting of blockades on Ukrainian cereal and fertilizer exports through the Black Sea.

Alarm raised over worsening drought in Horn of Africa. A severe drought already affecting millions in the Horn of Africa looks set to get dramatically worse, UN and humanitarian agencies warned this week. The March-May rainy season appears likely to be the driest on record and there is risk that the October-December rainy season could also fail, deepening a humanitarian emergency in Ethiopia, Somalia and parts of Kenya, including a risk of famine in Somalia, they said. On Monday, Somalia’s Special Envoy for Drought Response, Abdirahman Abdishakur, warned that people had started to die because of the record drought affecting more than six million people – close to half the country’s population.
US in talks with Canada and Spain to take in more refugees. The Biden administration is in talks with Canada and Spain ahead of next week’s Summit of the Americas about taking in more Western Hemisphere refugees, according to reports. Reuters cited US officials confirming that the country was in talks with Canada about taking in more refugees from the Americas region, ahead of a possible announcement at the summit. Spain, meanwhile, is considering a separate proposal to accept a “modest” but “symbolically important” number of refugees in addition to its existing programme for bringing in temporary workers from Central America, according to Axios. The summit will be held in Los Angeles from 6-10 June, with the US seeking greater regional cooperation to address migration.

Number of forcibly displaced tops 100 million. The number of people forced to flee violence, conflict, human rights violations and persecution has crossed the milestone of 100 million for the first time on record, propelled by the war in Ukraine and other conflicts, UNHCR said this week. “It’s a record that should never have been set,” said UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi. “This must serve as a wake-up call to resolve and prevent destructive conflicts, end persecution, and address the underlying causes that force innocent people to flee their homes.” The number of forcibly displaced reached 90 million at the end of 2021, propelled by conflicts in Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia and elsewhere. This year, the war in Ukraine has displaced 8 million people within their country while 6 million refugee movements have been registered from Ukraine. The 100 million figure includes refugees, asylum seekers and those displaced by conflict or violence inside their own countries. UNHCR will release its full set of global data on forced displacement for 2021 on 16 June in its annual Global Trends Report.
Heavy fighting in eastern DR Congo displaces thousands. At least 72,000 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s North Kivu Province have been displaced in recent days by fighting between government forces and militia claiming to be part of the M23 armed group. According to UNHCR, over the past week alone some 7,000 of those forced to flee have crossed into neighbouring Uganda, a country already hosting more than 1.5 million refugees. The clashes this week were concentrated around 25 kilometres north of Goma, the provincial capital. UNHCR said those on the move were exposed to constant violence, including rape and physical threats. Some are sheltering in sites established for people who fled the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption in May 2021, but UNHCR said needs heavily outweighed the available assistance due to underfunding of the response and the difficulty of accessing areas affected by the violence. The fighting comes as communities previously displaced by insecurity in the region had tentatively begun to return home to re-establish their lives.
Dozens missing after boat sinks off Tunisian coast. Seventy-five people were missing and presumed dead after their boat, which departed from Libya, sank off the coast of Tunisia on Tuesday. The boat was reportedly carrying about 100 people when it left the Libyan port city of Zuwara, but the Tunisian Coast Guard was only able to rescue 24 while one body was recovered. In a separate incident late on Tuesday, the Spanish NGO Open Arms, which operates search and rescue operations in the Central Mediterranean, found another boat in trouble in Tunisian waters. The overloaded boat capsized as the organization was calling for help to Italy and Malta. Although Open Arms rescued people from the water, a spokesperson said it was night and they could not be sure if they had rescued everyone. Prior to this week’s incident, 574 people had died or gone missing in the Mediterranean so far this year, according to UNHCR. The agency said it was the start of the season when calmer waters usually lead to increased numbers of boats attempting to cross the Mediterranean.

Protests along US-Mexico border after judge blocks lifting of Title 42. Migrants across northern Mexico voiced frustration and desperation this week after the US government did not lift a pandemic-era policy that has prevented many of them from seeking asylum in the United States for over two years. A ruling by a federal judge in Louisiana on Friday meant the policy known as Title 42 could not end on Monday as planned. The Biden administration said it would appeal the decision. In the meantime, Reuters reports that it is moving ahead with other changes at the border aimed at better managing new arrivals and speeding up processing of asylum claims. They include allowing US asylum officers to adjudicate claims directly instead of sending them to back-logged immigration courts, and court-ordered screenings to determine whether certain asylum-seeking families should be exempted from Title 42.
Somalia’s worsening drought claims lives. Reuters reports from the Somali town of Dollow, where families displaced by the worst drought in 40 years are arriving so weak from hunger that some young children are dying. A camp that sprang up in the town in January is now housing 13,000 people but there is only enough aid to help about half of them. As of May, over 6 million people have been affected by the drought, of whom 771,400 have been forced to abandon their homes to search for water, food and pasture. While six areas of the country are now facing the risk of famine, according to the UN, a plan to provide emergency aid is only 15 per cent funded. In its latest update, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said it expected the emergency to worsen with the next rainy season projected to be below average.
Boat carrying 842 Haitians abandoned at sea. UNHCR today expressed concern about the rising number of people from the Caribbean region, particularly from Haiti, risking dangerous journeys by sea. The worrying trend was highlighted this week by the arrival of a vessel carrying over 800 Haitians in Cuba. Some of the boat’s passengers told AP they had paid smugglers thousands of dollars to reach the United States before being ushered onto a dilapidated boat which was later abandoned by its captain and left to drift at sea for several days before being rescued by Cuban authorities. A spike in gang-related violence, political instability and high unemployment has prompted thousands of Haitians to flee their country in the past year. Describing the humanitarian and security conditions in Haiti as “dire”, UNHCR warned against pushbacks and forced returns and said it was working with governments in the region to strengthen reception and asylum systems.

Nearly 60 million people internally displaced worldwide by end of 2021. Conflicts and natural disasters pushed tens of millions to flee within their own countries last year, taking the total number of internally displaced people to a record high of 59.1 million (53.2 million due to conflict and 5.9 million due to disasters), according to an annual report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) released on Thursday. Around 38 million new internal displacement movements were reported between January and December 2021, with conflict and violence triggering 14.4 million movements, a 50 per cent increase on the year before. More than 5 million of the displacements were in Ethiopia, as the country grappled with the ongoing conflict in Tigray, while the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and Myanmar also saw unprecedented levels of conflict-related displacement. Extreme weather such as cyclones, floods and droughts accounted for 94 per cent of the 23.7 million internal displacements caused by disasters. Increasingly, conflict and disasters are colliding, forcing people to flee several times. Figures are expected to grow further this year, driven by the war in Ukraine where 8 million people have already been displaced within the country. “2022 is looking bleak,” IDMC director Alexandra Bilak told reporters.
UK, Rwanda defend asylum seeker deal to UN agencies. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and Rwandan Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta met with top officials from UNHCR and the UN human rights agency in Geneva on Thursday about controversial plans to send some asylum seekers from the UK to the African country. Ahead of the meetings, Biruta told AP that the discussion aimed “to bring them on board” to work with the two countries, but after meeting with the two ministers, UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi reiterated the agency’s concerns about the plan. “Shifting asylum responsibilities is not the solution,” he tweeted, adding that UNHCR would “continue proposing concrete alternatives that respect international refugee law”. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last weekend that a first group of 50 asylum seekers had been told they would be sent to Rwanda within two weeks, but the government on Thursday said it had been forced to delay the flights until next month due to legal challenges by several charities and a union representing Home Office staff. One Sudanese asylum seeker who received a “notice of intent” told The Guardian he had fled a massacre in his village and spent three years trying to reach the UK before crossing the Channel in a kayak. He said the prospect of being sent to Rwanda had triggered flashbacks.
Conflict brings world to “brink of mass hunger”, says UN chief. “When war is waged, people go hungry,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres told the Security Council on Thursday during a debate on conflict and food security. He noted that 60 per cent of the world’s undernourished people live in areas affected by conflict. “No country is immune,” he added, noting that Ukraine was a major exporter of food before the war and is now a recipient of food aid. The combination of armed conflict, the climate crisis and economic insecurity in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have reversed decades of progress on averting hunger, said the UN chief. He expressed particular concern about acute food insecurity in both the Sahel and the Horn of Africa, where millions of people are expected to face famine within months. The war in Ukraine has worsened global hunger by triggering price increases in countries across Africa and the Middle East. The cost of food assistance has also increased, forcing humanitarian agencies to scale back support in some places. Guterres called for an end to the war in Ukraine and for donors to fully fund appeals. Currently, Global Humanitarian Response Plans for 2022 are only 8 per cent funded.

US authorities say they are prepared for border restrictions to end. During a tour of the US-Mexico border on Tuesday, US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said authorities are prepared for an anticipated increase in migrants and asylum seekers crossing the border when a public health order that has been in place since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 is lifted. The order, known as Title 42, has been used more than 1.8 million times to turn away migrants at the border, including those seeking asylum. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last month that Title 42 was no longer needed for health reasons and would end on 23 May, but a federal judge is expected rule in the coming days over whether to block its termination following a lawsuit brought by a coalition of more than 20 states.
UNHCR calls on States to lift remaining COVID-related asylum restrictions. More than two years after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, 20 countries across the world are still denying access to asylum as part of public health measures. At the height of the pandemic, 100 countries restricted access to asylum seekers. While the latest figure represents an improvement, UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi on Friday appealed to those States maintaining restrictions “to lift them urgently” so that people fleeing wars and persecution were not denied their right to seek asylum. UNHCR has provided guidance and technical advice on how countries can address public health risks while upholding their obligations to asylum seekers under international law. “I am worried that measures enacted on the pretext of responding to COVID-19 are being used as cover to exclude and deny asylum to people fleeing violence and persecution,” said Grandi.
Fighting intensifies in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region. Ukrainian officials said residential districts in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region were coming under heavy bombardment on Friday, destroying houses and killing an unknown number of civilians. Meanwhile, the UN said humanitarian needs are growing in southern Khersonska oblast where medicines, food and cash are in short supply and volunteers with humanitarian aid are not being allowed access. As the war neared its three-month mark, almost a third of Ukraine’s people have fled their homes, including million who have fled the country. The US Senate approved nearly US$40 billion in new aid for Ukraine this week, the largest US aid package for Ukraine to date.

THIS WEEK’S TOP STORIES
At least 11 dead after boat capsizes off Puerto Rico. At least 11 people died and 31 others were rescued on Thursday after a boat carrying migrants and asylum seekers capsized off Puerto Rico’s Desecheo Island. The US Coast Guard said it was not known how many people had been on the boat when it set off from the Dominican Republic and that rescue efforts were still underway on Thursday night. According to reports, most of those on board were from Haiti, which is struggling with a surge in gang-related violence in its capital, Port-au-Prince, that has killed dozens of people and displaced more than 19,000 since June 2021. Last week, the UN expressed concern about the deteriorating security situation, including a sharp increase in kidnappings for ransom. The capsizing on Thursday was the latest in a string of such incidents across the region as people from Haiti and the Dominican Republic attempt to reach the United States in overloaded and often unseaworthy boats. Responding to the tragedy, UNHCR applauded the rescue efforts and said it was “also imperative to ensure that any individuals who may be in need of international protection are identified and can have their asylum claims assessed”.
As refugee movements out of Ukraine top 6 million, some risk return. As of Wednesday, more than 6 million refugee movements out of Ukraine had been recorded since the start of war, according to UNHCR. At the same time, authorities have reported some 1.5 million movements back into the country, despite the situation remaining highly volatile and unpredictable. AFP reports from the capital, Kyiv, where Mayor Vitali Klitschko claims nearly two-thirds of the city’s 3.5 million inhabitants have returned. While some continue to leave – fearful of fighting, shelling and strikes – others are crossing to reunite with or visit family in western Ukraine and Kyiv where the situation has somewhat improved. Across the country, some 8 million people have been internally displaced and 13 million are estimated to be trapped by fighting and unable to meet their basic needs for food, water and medicines. UNHCR said the delivery of life-saving aid remained “challenging”. Separately, the UN Human Rights Council voted on Thursday to investigate possible war crimes in several regions that were temporarily held by Russian troops. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet cited a mounting number of reports and testimonies pointing to possible war crimes, including the discovery of 1,000 civilian bodies in the Kyiv region alone. She said some had been killed in hostilities, but others appear to have been summarily executed.
Donors pledge US$6.7 billion in aid for Syrians. International donors on Tuesday pledged US$6.7 billion to support Syrians in need of aid inside their country, those living as refugees and their hosting countries in the region. Ahead of the annual pledging conference in Brussels, UN chiefs noted that humanitarian needs inside Syria were at their most acute since the crisis began over 11 years ago, with 14.6 million people in Syria now relying on aid – 1.2 million more than last year. Aid agencies warn that the hit to global agricultural supplies from the war in Ukraine could further worsen food insecurity both inside Syria, and in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey hosting large numbers of Syrian refugees. Donors pledged US$4.3 billion for this year and $2.4 billion “for 2023 and beyond” – similar to amounts pledged last year, despite increased needs. The UN had sought $10.5 billion for 2022 to cover its Humanitarian Response Plan for Syria and the Regional Refugee and Resilience Plan.

Aid agencies warn of growing hunger crisis in Sahel. International aid organizations on Thursday said climate change, drought and insecurity are contributing to a rapidly worsening hunger crisis in Africa’s Central Sahel region. About 4 million children under the age of 5 are at risk of acute malnutrition in the coming weeks, according to Save the Children. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) estimated that 10.5 million people in total were likely to go hungry during the coming “lean season” between harvests. A severe drought has reduced food production while conflict and insecurity, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, has compounded the problem – forcing people to abandon their homes and crops. The UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) this week published a report revealing that the number and duration of droughts have risen by nearly 30 per cent since 2000.
An asylum seeker’s dangerous odyssey through the Americas. This interactive report by The New Humanitarian follows one Cuban asylum seeker’s journey over eight months as he travels towards the US border. Through maps, WhatsApp voice recordings and text, the report traces his route from the entrance to the Darien Gap – a jungle corridor between Colombia and Panama controlled by armed groups and smugglers – through Central America and Mexico. The 40-year-old encounters risks at every stage of his journey from trekking through treacherous terrain in the Darien Gap to being robbed in Costa Rica, narrowly escaping detention in Nicaragua and dodging cartels in Mexico. “It is one of the most dangerous migration routes in the world,” William Spindler, UNHCR’s Latin America spokesperson told The New Humanitarian. “But we only hear about it at bottlenecks or when tragedies happen.”
Conflict and climate shocks worsen crisis in northern Mozambique. Five tropical storms and cyclones have battered Mozambique’s northern coastal areas since the start of the year. In March, Tropical Cyclone Gombe alone affected more than 736,000 people, including refugees and internally displaced people. UNHCR warned this week that the growing impact of the climate crisis is “amplifying vulnerability, driving displacement and making life harder for refugees, the internally displaced, and host communities” in Mozambique. Meanwhile, the violence in northern Cabo Delgado province continues to cause new displacement, and to prevent aid agencies from reaching people in need. UNHCR has been responding in some of the areas affected by Gombe and other storms, but said the response was significantly underfunded.

THIS WEEK’S TOP STORIES
Efforts to evacuate Ukraine’s Mariupol continue. Some 100 civilians trapped for weeks in bunkers under a steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol reached Ukrainian-held territory early this week. Evacuees from the Azovstal plant arrived to a processing centre in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia through a safe passage operation coordinated by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Hundreds more people were moved out of Mariupol and surrounding towns on Thursday and a third UN-led operation to evacuate the remaining civilians from the steelworks was due to get underway today. UNHCR is providing the new arrivals with basic relief items and support. An estimated 7.7 million Ukrainians are now displaced inside their country while more than 5.7 million have fled to neighbouring countries. UN independent human rights experts have highlighted the dire humanitarian situation for internally displaced people, the majority of them women and children, including shortages of food, water and medicines, and the threat of sexual violence. Describing the mounting civilian suffering at an international donor conference in Warsaw on Thursday, UN relief chief Martin Griffiths noted that the most vulnerable, such as the elderly and people with disabilities, are “simply stuck” and unable to seek shelter from bombs. The conference raised a reported US$6.5 billion.
Conflict drives record levels of food insecurity. The number of people without enough food to eat reached an all-time high last year and is poised to reach “appalling” new levels as the Ukraine war affects global food production, the UN said this week. Nearly 193 million people in 53 countries suffered from acute food insecurity in 2021, according to an annual report released by the Global Network Against Food Crises, an alliance that includes the UN, the EU and governmental and non-governmental agencies. The figure represents an increase of 40 million from already record numbers in 2020. The reports’ authors identified conflict as the main driver of the increase with countries experiencing protracted conflicts, such as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, South Sudan and Yemen having the most food-insecure populations. Weather extremes and economic shocks also played a role. The UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) noted that several countries already battling major food crises last year obtained almost all their wheat imports from Russia and Ukraine and warned that the “outlook moving forward is not good”.
UK plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda hit by delays. The UK government’s plan to start sending some asylum seekers to Rwanda may take longer to be implemented as the policy faces legal challenges. Two legal letters, which could pave the way for formal legal action, question the lawfulness of the government’s plan and what criteria would be used for asylum-seekers to be removed to Rwanda. UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi has also suggested that the policy would “run counter to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention”. The Border Force union ISU warned that smugglers are using the new policy to encourage asylum-seekers to risk dangerous Channel crossings before it goes into effect. Since the start of 2022, 7,240 people have reached the UK in small boats. Crossings continued this week as weather conditions improved.
STORIES TO WATCH
Turkey announces plan to increase voluntary returns of Syrians. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan this week announced a large-scale project to build homes for some 1 million returning Syrian refugees in areas of northern Syria secured by Turkish forces. Turkey is host to some 3.7 million registered Syrian refugees, but the New York Times reports that amidst a worsening economy, the government is under pressure to address growing hostility towards them. Turkey has already built more than 57,000 out of 77,000 planned homes in Syria’s northwest Idlib Province and plans to start a new project that will build homes in other parts of northern Syria, but it is unclear how many Syrians will volunteer to return. UNHCR said it had recorded 130,000 voluntary returns since 2016 but noted that not all returns had been recorded.
Niger faces refugee influx. More than 36,000 refugees arrived in Niger between January and mid-April after fleeing attacks by armed groups in neighbouring Nigeria, Mali and Burkina Faso. With an average of more than 2,500 new arrivals a week to a country already hosting 580,000 forcibly displaced people, including 360,000 refugees, UNHCR’s representative in Niger Emmanuel Gignac expressed concern on Wednesday that “As humanitarians, we are reaching our limits”. The refugees, mostly women and children, are settling in some of Niger’s driest areas where food prices have risen dramatically due to a poor farming season last year. During a visit to Niger this week, UN Secretary General António Guterres promised to be a “spokesperson” for the displaced and to demand more support to Niger from the international community.
New Zealand agrees to stop detaining asylum seekers. The New Zealand government has accepted the recommendations from an independent review into the country’s long-term detention of asylum seekers in prisons. UNHCR welcomed the recommendations and said it stood ready to work with the government to implement the changes. Under current law, asylum seekers can be held in prison if they arrive using false documents or are deemed a security risk. According to news reports, between 2015 and 2020, about 100 asylum seekers were imprisoned out of 2,500 who filed asylum claims. The review by Victoria Casey QC calls for a law change, noting that any form of detention should be a last resort and have a time limit.

US$1.85 billion needed to help refugees from Ukraine in 2022. UNHCR and its partners this week urged donors to provide US$1.85 billion to support up to 8.3 million refugees who could flee Ukraine by the end of the year. The appeal is part of a Regional Refugee Response Plan (RRRP) involving 142 organizations including UN agencies, national and international NGOs, civil society and others. The plan will support countries already hosting more than 5.3 million refugees in providing access to protection, food security, health care and education, as well as cash assistance to help refugees meet their basic needs. “Until we see an end to this war, humanitarian needs will continue to grow, and displacement will not cease,” UNHCR spokesperson Shabia Mantoo told journalists in Geneva on Tuesday. “The scale of refugee arrivals and the breadth of their needs requires further support.” Visiting Kyiv on Thursday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said the UN was planning for a worst-case scenario in which up to 25 million people may require humanitarian assistance by the end of the year inside Ukraine, where 7.7 million people have already fled their homes to other parts of the country. Guterres pledged to keep working for an end to the conflict and the establishment of effective humanitarian corridors to give Ukrainians “an escape route out of the apocalypse”.
Fears that new UK immigration law will dramatically weaken refugee protection. New immigration rules adopted by the UK on Thursday will undermine established refugee protection law and practices, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi warned this week. The UK’s Nationality and Borders Act seeks to deter people from seeking asylum in the country by relegating most refugees to a new, lesser status with few rights and the constant threat of removal. “This latest UK Government decision risks dramatically weakening a system that has for decades provided protection and the chance of a new life to so many desperate people,” Grandi said in a statement following approval of the bill. He also expressed concern at the UK government’s intention to externalize its obligation to protect refugees and asylum seekers after it announced plans to send some migrants to Rwanda for processing of their asylum claims. “Such efforts to shift responsibility run counter to the letter and spirit of the Refugee Convention, to which the UK is a party,” Grandi added. Earlier this week, lawyers for the UK government announced the withdrawal of plans to force people trying to enter the country on boats via the Channel back to the country of departure, days before a scheduled high court hearing on the policy.
Urgent action needed to prevent soaring deaths on sea routes to Europe. More support is urgently needed to address a rising number of deaths on the main sea routes to Europe, UNHCR warned on Friday, after the number of people who died or went missing attempting the journey rose sharply last year. More than 3,000 people were drowned or lost at sea attempting to reach Europe via the Central and Western Mediterranean and Atlantic routes in 2021, compared with 1,776 the previous year, according to a new report. An additional 478 people have died or gone missing on these routes since the start of this year. Of the 2021 total, 1,924 were lost trying to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa, while a further 1,153 perished or disappeared attempting to reach the Canary Islands from countries in West Africa. “Most of the sea crossings took place in packed, unseaworthy, inflatable boats – many of which capsized or were deflated leading to the loss of life,” a UNHCR spokesperson said. To address the rising number of fatalities, the agency launched an updated strategy to deliver meaningful alternatives to such dangerous journeys, calling for US$163.5 million to provide humanitarian assistance, support and solutions for people in need of international protection.

Surging needs among 35,000 refugees arriving in Uganda since start of 2022. More than 35,000 refugees require critical humanitarian assistance having arrived in Uganda since the start of this year after fleeing violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and South Sudan. UNHCR on Friday said US$47.8 million was needed to provide food, shelter, health care and other essential services to the refugees, a third of whom have arrived from the DRC in the past three weeks fleeing fighting in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. UNHCR is working with the Government of Uganda and humanitarian partners to provide assistance in border areas and relocate refugees to safer settlements as soon as possible, the agency added. Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population on the African continent at over 1.5 million refugees –– a figure that could continue to rise amid reports of further violence in South Sudan and eastern DRC.
US judge temporarily blocks phasing out of Title 42 border policy. A federal judge in Louisiana on Wednesday issued a restraining order temporarily blocking the Biden administration from gradually ending pandemic-related border restrictions until the policy is officially lifted. The US government plans to lift Title 42 – a public health order that has seen most migrants, including asylum seekers, turned away from the US border for the past two years – on 23 May. In the meantime, Judge Robert R. Summerhays granted a request supported by more than 20 states to prevent border authorities from taking early steps to disregard Title 42 for certain migrants and process them under immigration procedures. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton has filed a separate case seeking to block the lifting of Title 42. A federal judge in Texas has yet to rule on that case.
States agree to step up support to 1.4 million displaced Central Africans. Ministers from seven countries signed a declaration on Wednesday pledging more concerted action to help nearly 1.4 million people displaced by successive crises in the Central African Republic (CAR). Adopted at a ministerial conference organized by UNHCR in the Cameroonian capital, the Yaoundé Declaration will establish a regional coordination mechanism to provide solutions for Central Africans with the support of the international community. Solutions will include the removal of legal barriers to employment opportunities, training, and access to social services in six neighbouring countries that together host around 700,000 Central African refugees. CAR’s Minister for Humanitarian Action, Virginie Baikoua, thanked partners for their support and reassured them of her country’s determination to restore peace and stability.

Civilians in eastern Ukraine urged to evacuate while they still can. Ukraine tried to evacuate as many trapped civilians as possible on Thursday as the country braced for a battle to take control of the eastern region. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said agreement had been reached with Russia on the opening of 10 humanitarian corridors for the evacuation of civilians, mostly in southern and eastern Ukraine, although residents trying to leave the besieged southern city of Mariupol would have to use their own vehicles. UNHCR said today it was working closely with local authorities in Ukraine to increase their capacity to receive those fleeing. The agency is delivering relief items and providing protection services at centres set up to receive the internally displaced, who now number 7.1 million. Spokesperson Matthew Saltmarsh said delivering aid to parts of the country where there is active fighting remained challenging, but that a humanitarian convoy reached Luhansk in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday and other convoys have reached Sumy and Kharkiv. Poland remains the country receiving the largest number of refugees. Although the pace of new arrivals is slowing, more than 2.5 million people fleeing the war have arrived in Poland since 24 February.
Rights groups allege crimes against humanity in Ethiopia’s Tigray. Alleged abuses against civilians in the western part of Ethiopia’s Tigray region since the start of the conflict in November 2020 amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to a joint report by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch released on Wednesday. Based on interviews with 400 people over 15 months, the report finds that hundreds of thousands of Tigrayan civilians have been forced from their homes using threats, killings and sexual violence as part of “a relentless campaign of ethnic cleansing”. Amnesty and HRW also accused officials and forces in the neighbouring Amhara region of denying humanitarian aid to civilians in western Tigray. Last week, the UN said the first convoy of aid in 100 days had reached Tigray’s capital, Mekelle, following the announcement of a “humanitarian truce” by Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed. Ethiopian authorities said on Wednesday they were “carefully examining” allegations in the report.
Ukrainians shelter in Mexico as they wait to cross US border. The New York Times reports that more than 2,000 Ukrainians had made their way to Tijuana on the Mexican border with the US over the course of 10 days. Dozens of Russian-speaking volunteers, religious organizations and private groups have rushed in to provide food, shelter and medical support, but the arrivals present a challenge for US border officials already bracing for an expected increase in asylum seekers amid plans to lift Title 42 public health restrictions on 23 May. The Biden administration announced last month that the United States will accept 100,000 Ukrainians, but limited details have been revealed and appointments at US consulates in Europe are scarce. Meanwhile, Ukrainians can fly into Mexico without a visa. Volunteers told AP about 200 to 300 Ukrainians were being admitted daily at the San Ysidro crossing in Tijuana this week.

Australia releases refugees from detention. Australia on Thursday released 26 refugees from detention facilities across the country. In a statement welcoming the government’s decision, UNHCR called for an end to Australia’s policy of mandatory detention for asylum seekers who attempt to reach the country by boat, noting that the average period refugees are held has increased to 925 days. The agency said its monitoring of detention facilities over the past decade found that such extended periods of confinement were detrimental to the health of people seeking protection. Most of the released detainees had previously been held in offshore detention facilities on Nauru and in Papua New Guinea before being medically evacuated to Australia. Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews said those released would have the option to return to Nauru, seek resettlement in New Zealand or the United States, or return to their home country, but would not be allowed to settle in Australia.
Thailand returns Myanmar refugees to danger. AP reports that Thailand has sent back thousands of people fleeing escalating violence in Myanmar, forcing some refugees to move back and forth across the river which marks the border between the two countries. Thai government sources estimate over 19,000 Myanmar refugees have sought safety in Thailand since the military takeover last February, but only around 2,000 have remained on the Thai side of the border. Thai authorities say the refugees returned voluntarily, but those interviewed by AP said Thai officials had sent them back and they are now living in a flood-prone encampment on the Myanmar side of the river. Others are staying on the Thai side of the river where food and other supplies are scarce, with Thai authorities not granting UNHCR and international NGOs full access to the refugees. UNHCR has said that refugees fleeing violence and persecution in Myanmar should not be forcibly returned there.t significant numbers of Venezuelans are also heading south to Chile, but that they face difficult journeys through high altitudes and increasing controls at Chile’s border with Bolivia, including a heavily guarded trench.
Yemen ceasefire raises hopes amid peace talks. A UN-brokered two-month ceasefire went into effect in Yemen on Saturday – the first day of the holy month of Ramadan – offering a glimmer of hope that a political process aimed at ending the six-year conflict could resume. The terms of the truce include halting all military operations across Yemen, allowing ships carrying fuel into the port of Hudaydah and allowing two commercial flights a week into the capital, Sana’a. The ceasefire coincided with separate talks between some of the warring parties in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. UN special envoy Hans Grundberg stressed the importance of building on the ceasefire agreement to restore trust and begin full peace talks. The conflict has displaced some 4 million Yemenis and left more than 20 million in need of humanitarian assistance.
